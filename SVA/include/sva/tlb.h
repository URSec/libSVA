     * call sva_initvmx() on each of those CPUs individually. In theory, the

     * not others, and then taking advantage of the fact that
     * initDeclaredPage() and get_frame_from_os() operations on the CPUs
     * where VMX is not initialized will neglect to flush EPT/VPID TLB
     * entries. We would need to think about this a bit more to determine
     * whether a feasible attack could actually arise from this, but this
     * comment stands for now out of an abundance of caution.
     *
     * In practice, this shouldn't be a problem as the system software will
     * typically initialize VMX on all CPUs during boot. As SVA provides no
     * mechanism to *disable* VMX on a CPU once it's enabled, an attacker
     * could not exploit this thereafter. With security measures such as
     * secure boot in place we can generally assume that such boot-time
     * initialization will be performed as intended since most attack
     * surfaces for compromise of the system software are not exposed until
     * after (or later in) boot.
